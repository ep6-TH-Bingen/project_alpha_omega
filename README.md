# project_alpha_omega

This is our term project for a computer science class at UAS Bingen. Our aim is to create a traffic simulation. The team members are:
* [Ralf](https://github.com/RalfBr)
* [SÃ¶ren](https://github.com/SoerenDbl)
* [Dominik](https://github.com/Domm2501)
* [Eden](https://github.com/EdenTewelde)

Our lecturer is [Nicolai Parlog](https://github.com/nicolaiparlog).

We have to solve the [tasks](https://olat.vcrp.de/auth/RepositoryEntry/1676804160/CourseNode/95999652079122) in the limited period from 30.07.2017 (18:00) to 13.08.2017 (18:00).

## Application
To start our application first you have to open command prompt or Windows PowerShell. Navigate to the directory the jar-file is in. There you can run the following command:

```
java -jar project_alpha_omega-2.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```
Then the application does a simple traffic simulation consisting of cars (which decide whether they drive or don't drive) and a road network with a given capacity. The simulation shows
for each car, whether the capacity is reached and the cars are delayed or there is enough space for the cars to drive.

## Communication
For communication and code-sharing we use **_GitHub_** and **_Git_**.
For Programming we use [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).

- the language for coding should be English
- all communication on Github should be in English
